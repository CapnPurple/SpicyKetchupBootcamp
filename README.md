# Spicy Ketchup Testing
A compilation of programs to teach younger members of the robotics team.

Hello there! I see you've found our lovely little repository.

Assuming your new, or rusty, to FTC, Spicy Ketchup, or Java Programming, this is one of the many resources
you can use to learn a few tricks and tips that you might not have found out through the example programs
provided by FIRST, though those are also incredible.

This will be updated intermently and at the end of the season. Most of these programs are for learning
purposes. Additionally, other files, such as photos, will be included to assist. 

TO DO:
 - comment on current programs to explain thought process and purpose of programs.
