# Spicy Ketchup Testing
A compilation of programs to teach younger members of the robotics team.

Hello there! I see you've found our lovely little repository.

Assuming your new, or rusty, to FTC, Spicy Ketchup, or Java Programming, this is one of the many resources
you can use to learn a few tricks and tips that you might not have found out through the example programs
provided by FIRST, though those are also incredible.

This will be updated intermently and at the end of the season. Most of these programs are for learning
purposes. Additionally, other files, such as photos, will be included to assist. 

TO DO:
 - comment on current programs to explain thought process and purpose of programs.

Hi, new Spicy programmers. This GitHub repo is SO old. I'm working on adding some pseudocode and whatnot to help
you with the new season and our new tools, including Limelight and the GoBilda Husky camera. It should be assumed
that programs I write are NOT FUNCTIONAL and should be used as a guideline instead of a how-to, especially if
I worked on the pseudocode without a physical robot at hand. If a program is mostly plug and play, I will have it
written as such. Programs from the 2021 season are, however, plug and play, with some minor adjustments, as I did
write those so so so long ago with a robot/control hub deck at hand.
