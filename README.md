# SpicyKetchupBootcamp
A compilation of programs to teach younger members of the robotics team.

Hello there! I see you've found our lovely little repository.

Assuming your brand new to FTC, Spicy Ketchup, or Java Programming, this is one of the many resources
you can use to learn a few tricks and tips that you might not have found out through the example programs
provided by FIRST, though those are also incredible.
